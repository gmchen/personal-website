During my PhD research, I developed an interest in applying molecular technologies and computational methods to better understand and improve Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, a form of cancer immunotherapy. 

### Longitudinal analysis of long-persisting CAR T-cells

By longitudnally studying CAR T-cells from the first two succesfully treated cancer patients, we identified two unexpected populations of CAR T-cells: a gamma-delta CAR T-cell population, and a persistent CD4+ CAR T-cell population that dominated later time points. Single-cell analysis revealed that the intriguing CD4+ CAR T-cell population was highly proliferative, strongly activated, and expressed a distinct cytotoxic profile with _GZMA_ and _GZMK_ expression. These findings led us to re-think the CAR T-cell populations involved in long-term anti-cancer response, and have key implications in understanding the basis of effective CAR T-cell therapy.

### A bulk and single-cell atlas of pre-manufacture T-cells used in CAR T-cell therapy for pediatric ALL

In this project, we profiled the pre-manufacture T-cells in pediatric patients on trial to received CAR T-cell therapy using bulk RNA-Seq, CITE-Seq, and single-cell ATAC-Seq. We observed several T-cell factors associated with favorable clinical outcomes, including proportion of naive and early memory T-cells, expression of _TCF7_ among effector T-cells, and lower expression of _IRF7_ and interferon response genes. These data help to clarify the characteristics of patient T-cells that confer favorable CAR T-cell outcomes in patients.
