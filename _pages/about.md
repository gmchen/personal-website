I am an MD/PhD student in [Genomics and Computational Biology](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/){:target="\_blank"} at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania){:target="\_blank"}. I am interested in the ways in which data-driven science and high-throughput technologies can improve our understanding of health and disease. 

My PhD research involves the use of molecular technologies such as single-cell methods to better understand and improve [Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimeric_antigen_receptor_T_cell){:target="\_blank"} for the treatment of pediatric and adult cancers. Before joining Penn, I studied at [McMaster University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMaster_University){:target="\_blank"}, during which I performed computational biology research in the McMaster [Department of Chemistry & Chemical Biology](https://chemistry.mcmaster.ca/){:target="\_blank"} as well as at the [Ontario Institute for Cancer Research](https://oicr.on.ca/){:target="\_blank"} and [Princess Margaret Cancer Centre](https://www.uhnresearch.ca/institutes/pm){:target="\_blank"} with investigators at the [University of Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto){:target="\_blank"}.
